=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 finger_client( $server, $request, $callback, [ \%options ] )

Send a finger request to the given server.  The callback will
be called when the response is complete.  The options hash may
be passed in as the optional forth argument to override any
default options (See L<AnyEvent::Finger::Client> for details).

=head2 finger_server( $callback, [ \%options ] )

Start listening to finger callbacks and call the given callback
for each request.  See L<AnyEvent::Finger::Server> for details
on the options and the callback.

=head1 CAVEATS

Finger is an oldish protocol and almost nobody uses it anymore.

Most finger clients do not have a way to configure an alternate port.  
Binding to the default port 79 on Unix usually requires root.  Running 
L<AnyEvent::Finger::Server> as root is not recommended.
